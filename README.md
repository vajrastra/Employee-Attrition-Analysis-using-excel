# Employee Attrition Analysis using Excel

Welcome to the **Employee Attrition Analysis using Excel** repository! This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition trends over the past year to gain insights into the factors influencing employees' decisions to quit. By utilizing an Excel dataset, this analysis aims to shed light on patterns and characteristics associated with employee turnover.

## Overview

Employee attrition is a critical aspect of workforce management. Understanding the underlying reasons for employees leaving the organization can help improve retention strategies, create a more positive work environment, and enhance overall employee satisfaction.

## Data

The primary dataset for this analysis is located in the "Raw data" folder. It contains detailed information about various employee attributes, including income, promotion history, age, job satisfaction, job roles, and more.

## Analysis Process

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Unnecessary columns such as EmployeeNo, Attrition, JobRole, Education, Age, YearsSinceLastPromotion, MonthlyIncome, JobSatisfaction, and PerformanceRating were removed.
   - Duplicate rows were identified and removed.

2. **Data Exploration**:
   - Measurable differences were found in attributes such as MonthlyIncome, YearsSinceLastPromotion, Age, and JobSatisfaction between employees who quit and those who stayed.

3. **Key Findings**:
   - Employees who quit tend to have lower income, were promoted more recently, are younger, and have lower job satisfaction.
   - No significant difference in quitting behavior was observed based on education levels.
   - Certain job roles, including laboratory technicians, sales representatives, and human resources employees, exhibited higher attrition rates.
   - Predictive modeling estimates the likelihood of employee quitting, centered around the overall company attrition rate.
